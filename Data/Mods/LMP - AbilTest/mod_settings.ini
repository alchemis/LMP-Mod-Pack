#list of maps in the mod/Maps folder to be loaded, load order is important here. you must also include MapInfos.rxdata in the folder but NOT in the line
#list must be comma separated, for example
#Maps=Map001,Map003,Map005
#Maps=Map038,Map903

#this line decides whether to append tms to the existing list (define only the pokemon that you want to add or remove from each tm in the tms.txt if so),
#use !INTERNALID to remove and INTENALID to add a pokemon to a tm
#if this is true just use a normal tms.txt, in that case you must include the compatibility list for ALL pokemon,
#only use this when making a big content mod (for example updating all the tms to gen 8), and defaultLoadOrder should also be set to 1 for best results
#not implemented yet!!

#for smaller mods, if this setting is set to "true" it will disable adding new pokemon, and will only overwrite keys that exist in pokemon.txt, for example, if only
#level up move overwrites are defined in your pokemon.txt, it can be loaded after another mod which edits the same pokemon, and will only overwrite moves.
selectiveOverwrite=false

#this setting is to ignore added pokemon in pokemon.txt, and only overwrite. 
#it only does anything if selectiveOverwrite is enabled.
#if this isn't enabled and your pokemon.txt has pokemon that don't exist in the game, it will throw an error.
#it is used to make a mod that only overwrites a pokemon if it already exists, and does nothing if it doesn't. useful for overwriting other mods.
